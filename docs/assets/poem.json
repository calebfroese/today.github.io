[{"title":"Redemption","content":"Having been tenant long to a rich lord, \nNot thriving, I resolved to be bold, \nAnd make a suit unto him, to afford \nA new small-rented lease, and cancel the old. \nIn heaven at his manor I him sought; \nThey told me there that he was lately gone \nAbout some land, which he had dearly bought \nLong since on earth, to take possession.\nI straight returned, and knowing his great birth, \nSought him accordingly in great resorts; \nIn cities, theaters, gardens, parks, and courts; \nAt length I heard a ragged noise and mirth \nOf thieves and murderers; there I him espied, \nWho straight, Your suit is granted, said, and died.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/george-herbert\/redemption","poet":{"name":"George Herbert","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/george-herbert"}},{"title":"I Leave Her Weeping","content":"I leave her weeping in her barred little bed,\nher warm hand clutching at my hand,\nbut she doesn't want a kiss, or to hug the dog goodnight\u2014\nshe keeps crying mommy, uhhh, mommy,\nwith her lovely crumpled face\nlike a golden piece of paper I am throwing away.\nWe have been playing for hours,\nand now we need to stop, and she does not want\nto.
