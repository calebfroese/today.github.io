I love life! Even if I ever get \nto be old and wheezy\u2014or limp! You know? \nLimping along?\u2014I'd still ... ' Out of hearing. \nTo the multiple disordered tones \nof gears changing, a dance \nto the compass points, out, four-way river. \nProspect of sky \nwedged into avenues, left at the ends of streets, \nwest sky, east sky: more life tonight! A range \nof open time at winter's outskirts.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/denise-levertov\/february-evening-in-new-york","poet":{"name":"Denise Levertov","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/denise-levertov"}},{"title":"Lillie Of The Snowstorm","content":"To his home, his once white, once lov'd cottage,\nLate at night, a poor inebriate came;\nTo his wife, the waiting wife and daughter\nWho for him had fann'd the midnight flame.\nRudely met, they answer'd him with kindness --\nGave him all their own untasted store;\n'Twas but small, and he with awful curses,\nSpurn'd the gift, and drove them from the door.\n\nWhile the storm, the wild wild wintry tempest,\nSwept across the prairies cold and white;\n\nWhat a shame that Lillie and her mother\nWere abroad on such a fearful night!\n\nFar across the prairie stood a dwelling,\nWhere from harm they oft had found retreat;\nThither now, all brave and uncomplaining,\nDid they urge their weary, wayworn feet.\nBut their strength, unequal to their courage,\nFail'd them as they wander'd to and fro;\nTill at last, the feeble, fainting mother,\nSpeechless sank upon the drifted snow.\n\nLillie prays -- the harps are hush'd in Heaven --\nAngels poise them midway in the sky;\nUp from earth there comes a wail of sorrow,\nSuch a wail as must be heard on High.\n\"Father dear! my other, better Father!\nWon't you hear your daughter Lillie pray?\nWon't you send some strong and careful angel,\nWho will help my mother on her way?\"\n\nMorning dawns -- the husband and the father,\nSober'd now, to seek his flock has come;\nLillie dear is living, but her mother --\nHours ago, an angel bore her home.\nAh, poor man! how bitter is his anguish,\nAs he now repents his punish'd sins,\nBending o'er the child, who, half unconscious,\nSadly cries, \"Please father, let us in!\"","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/henry-clay-work\/lillie-of-the-snowstorm","poet":{"name":"Henry Clay Work","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/henry-clay-work"}},{"title":"Come Believing!","content":"Once again the Gospel message\nFrom the Savior you have heard;\nWill you heed the invitation?\nWill you turn and seek the Lord?\nRefrain\n\nCome believing! come believing!\nCome to Jesus! look and live!\nCome believing! come believing!\nCome to Jesus! look and live!\nMany summers you have wasted,\nRipened harvests you have seen;\nWinter snows by spring have melted,\nYet you linger in your sin.\nRefrain\nJesus for your choice is waiting;\nTarry not: at once decide!\nWhile the Spirit now is striving,\nYield, and seek the Savior\u2019s side.\nRefrain\nCease of fitness to be thinking;\nDo not longer try to feel;\nIt is trusting, and not feeling,\nThat will give the Spirit\u2019s seal.\nRefrain\nLet your will to God be given,\nTrust in Christ\u2019s atoning blood;\nLook to Jesus now in Heaven,\nRest on His unchanging Word.\nRefrain","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/daniel-webster-whittle\/come-believing","poet":{"name":"Daniel Webster Whittle","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/daniel-webster-whittle"}},{"title":"Ye Shall Return","content":"Ye who have dwelt in palaces\nOpulent and decayed and lone\nUpon oblivion's closer shore,\nBut in some daemon-stirred unrest\n\nDeparting thence, sojourn awhile\nBy fevered fens and driven seas,\nOr in the moil of towns unclean\nAnd fumes of toiling titan fires;\n\nOr climb the sharpened mountain-horns\nTo see earth's kingdoms gleam afar,\nLitters with promise and mirage\nBeneath a mistless diamond vault;\n\nOr, pausing in Mylitta's vales\nAt yonic altars carved to sin,\nPurchase the ancient carnal kiss\nForewritten on the lips of clay:-\n\nKnow surely that ye shall return\nInto the shadow-land ye left,\nAnd draw again your languored breath\nWhere breathe the poppies of the dusk.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/clark-ashton-smith\/ye-shall-return","poet":{"name":"Clark Ashton Smith","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/clark-ashton-smith"}}]
