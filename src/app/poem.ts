[ { title: 'At The Cementary', content: 'Rotten stone towers sultrily warmed.

Yellow haze of incense hovers.

Bees hum chaotically swarmed

And the flower trellises shake.

Slowly a breath stirs there

By the sun-still walls,

Dwindles glimmering, like a deceit -

Songs for the dead deeply shiver away.

Long it listens after in the green,

Lets the bushes shine brighter;

Brown swarms of mosquitoes spray

Over old tombstones', url: 'https://www.poemist.com/georg-trakl/at-the-cementary', poet: { name: 'Georg Trakl', url: 'https://www.poemist.com/georg-trakl' } }, { title: 'Te Deum Laudamus', content: 'I will praise God alway for each new year,
Knowing that it shall be most worthy of
His kindness and His pity and His love.
I will wait patient, till, from sphere to sphere,
Across large times and spaces, ringeth clear

The voice of Him who sitteth high above,
Saying, “Behold! thou hast had pain enough;
Come; for thy Love is waiting for thee here!”
I know that it must happen as God saith.
I know it well. Yet, also, I know well
That where birds sing and yellow wild-flowers dwell,
Or where some strange new sunset lingereth,
All Earth shall alway of her presence tell
Who liveth not for me this side of death.', url: 'https://www.poemist.com/francis-joseph-sherman/te-deum-laudamus', poet: { name: 'Francis Joseph Sherman', url: 'https://www.poemist.com/francis-joseph-sherman' } }, { title: 'The Angel\'s Song', content: 'Rolling downward, through the midnight,
Comes a glorious burst of heav’nly song;
’Tis a chorus full of sweetness—
And the singers are an angel throng.

Refrain

“Glory! glory in the highest!
On the earth goodwill and peace to men!”
Down the ages send the echo;
Let the glad earth shout again!

Wond’ring shepherds see the glory,
Hear the word the shining ones declare;
At the manger fall in worship,
While the music fills the quiv’ring air.

Refrain

Christ the Savior, God’s Anointed,
Comes to earth our fearful debt to pay—
Man of sorrows, and rejected,
Lamb of God, that takes our sin away.

One around every turn. 
Sometimes you make the right choice- 
Sometimes you get burned. Is the path you take for love? 
Or is it for hate? 
Careful with the path you pick. 
For it determines your fate. Some feel the path is chosen for them, 
And rarely give it a thought. 
Take a look at your life however- 
Is it the one you sought? Do not choose lightly. 
Or walk through life blind. 
Your life can be an adventure 
You never know what you will find.', url: 'https://www.poemist.com/antonio-simoneli/crossroads', poet: { name: ' Antonio Simoneli', url: 'https://www.poemist.com/antonio-simoneli' } }, { title: 'A Moral Vindicator', content: 'If Mr. Jones, Lycurgus B.,
Had one peculiar quality,
\'Twas his severe advocacy
Of conjugal fidelity.

His views of heaven were very free;
His views of life were painfully
Ridiculous; but fervently
He dwelt on marriage sanctity.

He frequently went on a spree;
But in his wildest revelry,
On this especial subject he
Betrayed no ambiguity.

And though at times Lycurgus B.
Did lay his hands not lovingly
Upon his wife, the sanctity
Of wedlock was his guaranty.

But Mrs. Jones declined to see
Affairs in the same light as he,
And quietly got a decree
Divorcing her from that L. B.

And what did Jones, Lycurgus B.,
With his known idiosyncrasy?
He smiled,--a bitter smile to see,--
And drew the weapon of Bowie.

He did what Sickles did to Key,--
What Cole on Hiscock wrought, did he;
In fact, on persons twenty-three
He proved the marriage sanctity.

The counselor who took the fee,
The witnesses and referee,
The judge who granted the decree,
Died in that wholesale butchery.

And then when Jones, Lycurgus B.,
Had wiped the weapon of Bowie,
Twelve jurymen did instantly
Acquit and set Lycurgus free.', url: 'https://www.poemist.com/francis-bret-harte/a-moral-vindicator', poet: { name: 'Francis Bret Harte', url: 'https://www.poemist.com/francis-bret-harte' } } ]
