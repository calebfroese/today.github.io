to have seen under the olive blossoms\nBut once-once only in a mortal life,\nThe marble majesties of ancient Gods!\nAnd to have watched the ring of listeners,\nThe Grecian boys gone mad for love of Truth,\nThe Grecian girls gone pale for love of him\nWho taught the truth, who battled for the truth;\nAnd girls and boys, women and bearded men,\nCrowding to hear and treasure in their hearts\nMatter to make their lives a happiness,\nAnd Death a happy ending.\nOne there was\nA meek disciple and an equal friend,\nWho night by night in rocky Megara\nWaited the coming of the evening star,\nAs young Leander waited for the lighting\nOf Hero's lamp; and when the star was up\nThen rose he from the watch, and flung aside\nThe broidered tunic and the leathern boot,\nMarking him masculine, and round his heart\nFolded a woman's robe, and on his foot\nBuckled a woman's shoe, and hid his beard\nUnder the wimple of a woman's hood,\nLest the bright glitter of its golden curl\nBring him to death, for there was come a law,\nTold to the city from the trumpet-mouth:-\n'If citizen of Megara shall tread\n'The stones of Athens, he shall surely die.'\nBut what are laws of men to him who lusted\nTo learn the laws of God; he journeyed on\nSafe in his secrecy, the weary stades\nFrom Megara to Athens, never failing.\nAnd from the early flower-buds that break\nTo see where summer tarries: to the frost\nThat glitters first of Autumn, all the nights\nHis soul was banqueting with Socrates.\nOne night-the last of all the happy nights-\nThey tracked him thitherward; he knew the fangs\nOf the fierce bloodhounds that had hunted him,\nThough they were habited in gentle guise\nOf teachable disciples, so he spake:-\n'Dear master, I have earned the right to listen\n'Only at cost of life, and they are here\n'Who know me for thy country's enemy,\n'And I must die, oh! is it pain to die?\n'Tell me one word of this fierce-fronted Death\n'Who strikes us to the soul.' Then answered he,\nThat mighty teacher of the right and wrong:\nWho told thee that death was dreadful to see,\nA withered and ghastly anatomy,\nFaint, longing heart?\nThat he rides in his wrath where the earth is red,\nStriking her daintiest children dead\nWith a venemous dart?\nHe weareth a dim and a shadowy form,\nLike the varying clouds of a summer storm\nWith beauty like theirs;\nAnd he speedeth o'er city and sea and land,\nWith a still soft step and a gentle hand,\nDrying up tears.\nAnd they that have gazed on his pitying look\nAre free to read in the spirit-book\nWhere all things are told;\nAnd the sick heart's struggle is over then,\nAnd the soul springs up from its earthly den\nTo its home of old.\nWhat though he come then, this gentle Death,\nWith a quick faint pang, and a flagging breath,\nShall we fear the meeting?\nMaiden and lover, and poet and slave,\nWe should welcome him well at the gate of the grave\nWith a proud, glad greeting.\nHe ended; and the nightingales anew\nSang clear contempt of pain, with feathered breasts\nBleeding against the thorn; the tear of terror\nDried into smile upon the scholar's cheek,\nA peaceful happy smile; that night he bought\nHis spirit's freedom with his body's blood.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/edwin-arnold\/academe","poet":{"name":"Edwin Arnold","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/edwin-arnold"}},{"title":"Revolution","content":"Spooky summer on the horizon I'm gazing at\nfrom my window into the streets\nThat's where it's going to be where everyone is\nwalking around, looking around out in the open\nsuspecting each other's heart to open fire\nall over the streets\n                              like streets you read about every day\nwho are the network we travel through on the way to the center   \nwhich is energy filling life\nand bursting with joy all over the screen\n                                                             I can't sit still any longer!\n\nI want to go where I'm not feeling so bad\nGet off this little island before the bridges break   \n(my heart is a sore thing too)\nNo I want to sit in the middle watching movies   \nthen go to bed in my head\nSomeone is banging on it with a heavy stick like the enemy\nwho is he going to be turns into a face you can't recognize\nthen vanishes behind a window behind a gun   \nLike the lonely hero stalking the main street   \ncries out Where are you?
