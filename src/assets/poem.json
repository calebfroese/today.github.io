\nAs soon you may in Winters deepest Snow, \nPerswade me Tenariff to climb, \nOr into \u00c6tna's scorching flame, \nMy Mortal Carcass throw, \nAs to a Tavern go\u2014I hate the Name. \nThere was indeed my Friend, there was a time, \nWhen to avoid the hurry, noise, and strife, \nWith the tumultuous Cares of Life, \nWe in an Evening o're a Bottle met, \nAnd while the tempting flowing Glass, \nDid round about in order pass, \nConferr'd we Notes of Pleasure, Love and Wit, \nThe Wine then was\u2014would a dull Muse inspire, \nMake Blockheads witty, Cowards bold; \nAnd in the bloodless, wither'd, old \nMen of Threescore blow up a youthful fire. \n\nII.\nBut now\u2014with what regret the Now I name, \nThe Wine we drink is now no more the same, \nIn former happy days it was, \nThan can a Man of Ninety Nine be said, \nWith Withered Limbs and hoary Head, \nTo be the self-same Creature as, \nHe was at Fourteen Years of Age. \nNo, no, the vigorous Heat, the Spirit's gone: \nThe Wine with which we now engage, \nHas not that body, taste, or age, \nIt had before the War began, \nIt either chills the blood\u2014or puts it in a flame.\n\nIII.\nWhat arts my friend you have? What tricks you use? \nMy easy Temper to seduce. \nMethinks a Tavern Door I enter in, \nWith such unwillingness as when a Maid, \nBy Oaths and Promises betraid, \nDoes venture on the Pleasing Sin. \nBut here most solemnly I vow, \nNot to exceed a Glass or two: \nNo Bumpers shall your Friendship fill me, \nOne Glass, if Aqua fortis, would not kill me.\n\nIV.\nSome Claret Boy\u2014Indeed Sir we have none. \nClaret Sir\u2014Lord there's not a Drop in Town; \nBut we've the best Red Port\u2014What's that you call \nRed Port?\u2014a Wine Sir comes from Portugal, \nI'll fetch a Pint Sir,\u2014Do make haste you Slave, \nIn things of sence what mighty faith some have, \nTo give their healths up to a Vintners Boy, \nWho with one Dash perhaps can it destroy: \nAnd when the threatning Gout or Fever comes, \nTo Quack in Velvet Coat, \nWho all his Learning has by roat, \nTo purchase Health again give lib'ral Sums. \n\nV.\nPray taste your Wine Sir,\u2014Sir, by your good favor, \nI'll view it first, and nose its flavor; \nIs this the Wine you so commend? \nPray look upon't my dearest Friend, \nIt looks almost as brown and yellow, \nAs is the face of warlike Fellow, \nWho has for seven Campaigns in Flanders lain, \nObserve, observe it once again; \nSee how Ten Thousand Attoms dance about the Glass; \nOf Eggs, and Lime, and Iseinglass: \nMark how it smells, methinks a real pain, \nIs by its odor thrown upon my brain. \nI've tasted it\u2014'tis spiritless and flat, \nAnd has as many different tastes, \nAs can be found in Compound pastes, \nIn Lumber Pye, or soporifrous Methridate. \n\nVI.\nSir, If you please, I'll a fresh Hogshead peirce. \nPeirce your own head you Dog\u2014which now contains, \nMaggots and Lies, instead of Brains. \nWhat other Wines you brewing Ass, \nHave you, you would for Clarets pass? \nSpeak quickly come their names rehearse. \nSir, We defy all London to compare, \nA Glass of Wine with our Navarre, \nAnd then for Barcelona, Syracuse, \nOr Carcavella now so much in use, \nWith rich Gallicia Wine a mighty Store, \nFlorence and\u2014hold you prating Whelp, no more, \nBut fetch us up a Pint of any sort, \nNavarre, Galicia, any thing but Port. \nYes Sir\u2014These nimble Rogues of Flippant Talk, \nHow merrily their Tongues can walk. \nAs sure as Moral Certainty, \nThe Vintners have some needy Spark in Fee, \nT' invent hard names for all their Wines, that so, \nThey off more quick, and currantly may go. \n\nVII.\nCome Boy the Wine\u2014I hope 'twill please you Sir, \nNo question on't\u2014Come of all Saints to th' Mother, \nA Health\u2014Pox take it, this is worse than t' other: \nFrom this Floors Center may I never stir, \nIf 'tis not sweet, and sowre, and hot, and smells \nOf Brimstone, or of something else. \nWine do you call this poys'nous Drink, \nThey'r quite besides their wits I think; \n'Tis Florence, Port, Navarre, and all together, \nFor Bacchus Boys, is not this lovely weather? \nHere, take your Money for your (Stuff call'd) Wine, \nWhich from this time I utterly decline.\n\nVIII.\nYou see my Friend, these Rogues by their pretences, \nHow they impose upon our very Sences: \nAnd we a Price extravagant allow, \nFor that Damn'd Stuff which in their Vaults they brew, \nWhich Mystery if we but throughly knew, \nSooner we'd leap into the Thames or Severn, \nThan Venture on the Wine in any Tavern.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/richard-ames\/a-farewell-to-wine-by-a-quondam-friend-to-the-bottle","poet":{"name":"Richard Ames","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/richard-ames"}}]
