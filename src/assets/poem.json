[{"title":"A Hillside Thaw","content":"To think to know the country and now know\nThe hillside on the day the sun lets go\nTen million silver lizards out of snow!\nAs often as I've seen it done before\nI can't pretend to tell the way it's done.\nIt looks as if some magic of the sun\nLifted the rug that bred them on the floor\nAnd the light breaking on them made them run.\nBut if I though to stop the wet stampede,\nAnd caught one silver lizard by the tail,\nAnd put my foot on one without avail,\nAnd threw myself wet-elbowed and wet-kneed\nIn front of twenty others' wriggling speed,- \nIn the confusion of them all aglitter,\nAnd birds that joined in the excited fun\nBy doubling and redoubling song and twitter,\nI have no doubt I'd end by holding none.\n\nIt takes the moon for this. The sun's a wizard\nBy all I tell; but so's the moon a witch.\nFrom the high west she makes a gentle cast\nAnd suddenly, without a jerk or twitch,\nShe has her speel on every single lizard.\nI fancied when I looked at six o'clock\nThe swarm still ran and scuttled just as fast.\nThe moon was waiting for her chill effect.\nI looked at nine: the swarm was turned to rock\nIn every lifelike posture of the swarm,\nTransfixed on mountain slopes almost erect.\nAcross each other and side by side they lay.\nThe spell that so could hold them as they were\nWas wrought through trees without a breath of storm\nTo make a leaf, if there had been one, stir.\nOne lizard at the end of every ray.\nThe thought of my attempting such a stray!","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/robert-frost\/a-hillside-thaw","poet":{"name":"Robert Frost","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/robert-frost"}},{"title":"Le coucou chante","content":"Le coucou chante au bois qui dort.\nL'aurore est rouge encore,\nEt le vieux paon qu'Iris d\u00e9core\nJette au loin son cri d'or.\n\nLes colombes de ma cousine\nPleurent comme une enfant.\nLe dindon roue en s'esclaffant :\nIl court \u00e0 la cuisine.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/paul-jean-toulet\/le-coucou-chante","poet":{"name":"Paul-Jean Toulet","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/paul-jean-toulet"}},{"title":"The Famous Historie: Cap.

to none\nTher pouer was such as all ther feir apeasd\nTher strength was such as broght ther curaige one\nBut this their pouer and this ther strength agrie\nTo bring them to ther end with imfamie.\nFor being two within for one without\nAnd heauing so impregnabill a hold\nThey fedd securitie and banist dout\nIn wain greate Bruce had spent his soldiers old\nWho had reneud th'assault ther walls about\nIn thryce seuine dayis full sewintie tyms, so bold\nAs, of nyne hundreith thryce, he with him broght\nSix hundreith soldiers he had lost for noght.\nWheir for by offering peace he tryd their

dight\nWheirin Tayis flood vp too the brinks did rise\nStill in thoes Touris and all thois Walls along\nWar armed men aboue five thousand strong.\nThen after he two months had staied before\nThe walls in haist he raisd his seige at last\nWheir with the Citizens with threatnings sore\nWold brag and taunt the armie as they past\nBut Scotlands campeoun wishd nothing more\nThen this their insolence and noght agast\nWith silence he reply'd nor minds to stay them\nFor ten to one he hops or long to pay them.\nThrie dayes the armie marcheth to the west\nTill they ariue within ane forrest faire\nAnd

all this hellish creu addrest\nThem selfs to flight to darknes they retire\nAnd in a sabill cloud them selfs they plac'd\nThen to the west they flie with Night their sire\nAnd all the way they went they left a track\nThat did infect the air with vapors blak\nThis they once gone both blood and slaughter ceast\nAll that wold yeeld was then to mercie tane\nStratherns old Erle got by his sones request\nHis Princes peace tho he wold not abstane\nTo help the toun for with the King at least\nHis sone remaind nor wold from him refrane\nAnd then the toune was leuelled with the ground\nThe walls

noise of voices, I stole out alone\nInto the darkness of the summer night.\nDown the long garden-walk I slowly went;\nA little wind was stirring in the trees;\nI only saw the whitest of the flowers,\nAnd I was sorry that the earlier hours\nOf that fair evening had been so ill spent,\nBecause, I said, I am content with these\nDear friends of mine who only speak to me\nWith their delicious fragrance, and who tell\nTo me their gracious welcome silently.\nThe leaves that touch my hand with dew are wet;\nI find the tall white lilies I love well.\nI linger as I pass the mignonette, \nAnd what surprise could dearer be than this:\nTo find my sweet rose waiting with a kiss!","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/sarah-orne-jewett\/flowers-in-the-dark","poet":{"name":"Sarah Orne

speaks to the page: \"With a nimble pace\n\nGo, fetch me my purse for gaming.\n\n 'Tis lying, I'll pledge,\n\n On my table's edge.\"\nEach nerve the nimble boy straineth,\nAnd the end of the castle soon gaineth.\n\nThe fairest of maidens was sipping sherbet\n\nBeside the queen that minute;\nNear her mouth broke the cup,--and she got so wet!\n\nThe very devil seem'd in it\n\n What fearful distress\n\n 'Tis spoilt, her gay dress.\nShe hastens, and ev'ry nerve straineth,\nAnd the end of the castle soon gaineth.\n\nThe boy was returning, and quickly came,\n\nAnd met the sorrowing maiden;\nNone knew of the fact,--and yet with Love's flame,\n\nThose two had their hearts full laden.\n\n And, oh the bliss\n\n Of a moment like this!\nEach falls on the breast of the other,\nWith kisses that well nigh might smother.\n\nThey tear themselves asunder at last,\n\nTo her chamber she hastens quickly,\nTo reach the queen the page hies him fast,\n\nMidst the swords and the fans crowded thickly.\n\n The queen spied amain\n\n On his waistcoat a stain;\nFor nought was inscrutable to her,\nLike Sheba's queen--Solomon's wooer.\n\nTo her chief attendant she forthwith cried\n\n\"We lately together contended,\nAnd thou didst assert, with obstinate pride,\n\nThat the spirit through space never wended,--\n\n That traces alone\n\n By the present were shown,--\nThat afar nought was fashion'd--not even\nBy the stars that illumine you heaven.\n\n\"Now see! while a goblet beside me they drain'd,\n\nThey spilt all the drink in the chalice;\nAnd straightway the boy had his waistcoat stain'd\n\nAt the furthermost end of the palace.--\n\n   Let them newly be clad!\n\n   And since I am glad\nThat it served as a proof so decided,\nThe cost will by me be provided.\"","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/johann-wolfgang-v-goethe\/effects-at-a-distance","poet":{"name":"Johann Wolfgang v Goethe","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/johann-wolfgang-v-goethe"}}]
