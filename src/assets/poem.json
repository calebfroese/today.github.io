[{"title":"Where The Blessed Feet Have Trod","content":"NOT alone in Palestine those blessed Feet have trod,\n        For I catch their print,\n        I have seen their dint\n        On a plot of chalky ground,\n        Little villas dotted round;\n        On a sea-worn waste,\n        Where a priest, in haste,\n        Passeth with the Bless\u00e8d Sacrament to one dying, frail,\n        Through the yarrow, past the tamarisk, and the plaited snail:\n        Bright upon the grass I see\n        Bleeding Feet of Calvary- \n        And I worship, and I clasp them round!\n        On this bit of chalky, English ground,\n        Jesu, Thou art found: my God I hail,\n        My Lord, my God!","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/michael-field\/where-the-blessed-feet-have-trod","poet":{"name":"Michael Field","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/michael-field"}},{"title":"The Ex Official's Lament","content":"Alas alas! my power is gone;\nI thought 'twould last for ever;\nBut now 'tis over, I must own,\nThey've done it very clever.\nI could have feather'd well my nest,\nIf I had been permitted;\nTo that intent I did my best,\nTo have my friend acquitted.\n'Congratulatory address'\nI also did procure him.\nAmong my influential class\nAnd thought this must secure him.\nIn fact, I left no means untried,\nTo smother up the matter,\nAnd on my influence relied,\nTo stop the diggers' chatter.\nBut rumours soon got spread about,\nOf this our camp proceeding;\nAnd very soon we all found out,\nThat discontent was breeding.\nAt last, the diggers on the place,\nDetermined to assemble:-\nWhich, when I saw I must confess;\nI inwardly did tremble.\nAnd yet to awe the vulgar crowd,\nI got the troopers round me;\nWhen groans and hisses long and loud,\nCompletely did confound me.\nMy brethren then with all their might,\nEndeavoured to allay them:-\nWhen lo! it rose to such a height;\nNo speech of ours could stay them.\nI, always thought the common herd\nShould render blind submission:-\nShould ne'er have once presumed or dared\nTo question our decision.\nBut, now they talk about their 'rights',\nAs much as their superiors:-\nThough 'Gentlemen' I'm certain quite,\nAll view them as inferiors.\nCould we but get them down once more,\nWe'd hold them in such fetters,\nAs would restrain them evermore,\nFrom meddling with their betters.\nBut, now, alas! I see no way,\nTo gratify my wishes:-\nWith all our schemes we've lost the day,\nFor getting loaves and fishes.\nIntelligence is gaining ground,\nWe can hold out no longer:-\nWhere'er I cast my eyes around,\nThe 'league' is getting stronger.\nLeft to our fate, we can but grieve,\nTo see their ranks increasing:\nOh! could we have have a short reprieve,\nThe diggers to be fleecing.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/william-gay\/the-ex-officials-lament","poet":{"name":" William Gay","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/william-gay"}},{"title":"At Tynemouth Priory","content":"AFTER A TEMPESTUOUS VOYAGE.\n\nAs slow I climb the cliff's ascending side,\nMuch musing on the track of terror past,\nWhen o'er the dark wave rode the howling blast,\nPleased I look back, and view the tranquil tide\nThat laves the pebbled shore: and now the beam\nOf evening smiles on the gray battlement,\nAnd yon forsaken tower that time has rent:--\nThe lifted oar far off with transient gleam\nIs touched, and hushed is all the billowy deep!\nSoothed by the scene, thus on tired Nature's breast\nA stillness slowly steals, and kindred rest;\nWhile sea-sounds lull her, as she sinks to sleep,\nLike melodies that mourn upon the lyre,\nWaked by the breeze, and, as they mourn, expire!","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/william-lisle-bowles\/at-tynemouth-priory","poet":{"name":"William Lisle Bowles","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/william-lisle-bowles"}},{"title":"Moon Rainbow","content":"Staid people say that Pan is dead\nBut they are wrong. His shaggy head\nI saw but yesterday at noon,\nAnd once before when shone the moon\nAcross Manoa Valley where The ginger blooms. \nThe evening air\nWas still\u2026so still it made me fear\nThat if I shivered He might hear.\nI waited while a silver mist\nSkimmed down the sky. A moonbeam kissed\nThe gauzy veil. Pan looked around\nAnd piped. A magic arch of sound\nCurved out upon the misty air\u2026\nA lunar rainbow shimmered there.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/donald-benson-blanding\/moon-rainbow","poet":{"name":"Donald Benson Blanding","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/donald-benson-blanding"}},{"title":"To K.B.","content":"You're here again - and of a sudden\nA warmth long gone floods my dead heart,\nAnd all I thought forgot, unbidden\nReturns, of me becomes a part.\n\nJust as spring's breath may soft come stealing\nUpon the air on late fall's day\nAnd rouse in us a vanished feeling\nOf life, of something young and gay -\n\nSo of past years do I recover\nThe richness, and on your sweet face\nWith all the ardour of a lover\nIn reawakened rapture gaze.\n\nToo long apart, drawn are we nearer\nOnce more - you're here, 'tis not a dream!\nSounds, ne'er within me stilled, the clearer\nAt sight of you and louder seem.\n\nRemembrance?- No! The rustling pages\nOf life turn fast - life's full again.\nYour loveliness stays ever changeless,\nMy love for you unchanged remains.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/fyodor-ivanovic-tyutchev\/to-kb","poet":{"name":"Fyodor Ivanovic Tyutchev","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/fyodor-ivanovic-tyutchev"}}]
