[{"title":"Epilogue To The Husband His Own Cuckold","content":"Like some raw sophister that mounts the pulpit, \nSo trembles a young poet at a full pit. \nUnused to crowds, the parson quakes for fear, \nAnd wonders how the devil he durst come there; \nWanting three talents needful for the place, \nSome beard, some learning, and some little grace. \nNor is the puny poet void of care; \nFor authors, such as our new authors are, \nHave not much learning, nor much wit to spare; \nAnd as for grace, to tell the truth, there's scarce one, \nBut has as little as the very parson: \nBoth say, they preach and write for your instruction; \nBut 'tis for a third day, and for induction. \nThe difference is, that though you like the play, \nThe poet's gain is ne'er beyond his day; \nBut with the parson 'tis another case, \nHe, without holiness, may rise to grace; \nThe poet has one disadvantage more, \nThat if his play be dull, he's damned all o'er, \nNot only a damn'd blockhead, but damn'd poor. \nBut dulness well becomes the sable garment; \nI warrant that ne'er spoiled a priest's preferment; \nWit's not his business, and as wit now goes, \nSirs, 'tis not so much yours as you suppose, \nFor you like nothing now but nauseous beaux. \nYou laugh not, gallants, as by proof appears, \nAt what his beauship says, but what he wears; \nSo 'tis your eyes are tickled, not your ears. \nThe tailor and the furrier find the stuff, \nThe wit lies in the dress, and monstrous muff. \nThe truth on 't is, the payment of the pit \nIs like for like, clipt money for clipt wit. \nYou cannot from our absent author hope, \nHe should equip the stage with such a fop. \nFools change in England, and new fools arise; \nFor, though the immortal species never dies, \nYet every year new maggots make new flies. \nBut where he lives abroad, he scarce can find \nOne fool, for million that he left behind.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/john-dryden\/epilogue-to-the-husband-his-own-cuckold","poet":{"name":"John Dryden","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/john-dryden"}},{"title":"I Neither Got Promise Of Siller","content":"AIR--_'Todlin' hame.'_\nI neither got promise of siller nor land\nWith the bonnie wee darling who gave me her hand;\nBut I got a kind heart with my sweet blushing bride,\nAnd that 's proved the bliss of my ain fireside.\nMy ain fireside, my dear fireside,\nThere 's happiness aye at my ain fireside!\n\nAmbition once pointed my view towards rank,\nTo meadows and manors, and gold in the bank:\n'Twas but for an hour; and I cherish with pride\nMy sweet lovely flower at my ain fireside.\nMy ain fireside, my happy fireside,\nMy Jeanie 's the charm of my ain fireside!\n\nHer accents are music; there 's grace in her air;\nAnd purity reigns in her bosom so fair;\nShe 's lovelier now than in maidenly pride,\nThough she 's long been the joy of my ain fireside.\nMy ain fireside, my happy fireside,\nThere 's harmony still at my ain fireside!\n\nLet the minions of fortune and fashion go roam,\nI 'm content with the sweet, simple pleasures of home;\nThough their wine, wit, and humour flow like a spring-tide,\nWhat are these to the bliss of my dear fireside?\nMy ain fireside, my cheerie fireside,\nThere are pleasures untold at my ain fireside!","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/david-vedder\/i-neither-got-promise-of-siller","poet":{"name":"David Vedder","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/david-vedder"}},{"title":"The Huntsman","content":"Give me the life of a huntsman,\nIt wants a lot of beating...\nI know, I've served my apprenticeship\nWith that famous hunter, ' Keating.'\n\nTally Ho, Tally Ho, Tantivy, \nWe shout as we ride pell mell,\nWhich means, if you say it backwards, \nTivytan\u2014that's a soldier's farewell!\n\nI've hunted from the cradle\nAnd from my baby chair, \nWhen mother has gone to the pictures\nAnd taken my supper there.\n\nHunting runs in our family,\nFather hunted Ma, \nThey had a hunting accident...\nI'm here, so there you are!\n\nI once played at ' Hunt the Slipper' \nAt a gentleman's house in Bristol,\nI found a pair his wife had on,\nNow he's hunting me with a pistol.\n\nFor a lady's beads I hunted,\nDown her back, I saw one of them roll. \nShe said, 'That'll do, I'm surprised at you,\nDon't you know a bead from a mole.'\n\nI remember once hunting the fox,\nTo pinch his brush was my intention,\nI wanted to whitewash the hen house and bathroom \nAnd places too numerous to mention.\n\nAnd I wanted a brush for shaving,\nTo soften the beard round my throttle.\nIt's horrible using a nail brush\nWhen you've skin like a baby's bottle.\n\nThe scene was the Squire's grounds\nAt his hunting seat in Hants, \nAnd from what I could see, you can take it from me,\nHe wanted a seat in his pants.\n\nWe stood by the old church tower, \nThe clock in the steeple struck none,\n'Twas early closing day that day \nThe hands had knocked off at one.\n\nAt the hunt they were dressed to kill, \nThe M.H., he looked very flighty,\nHis coat, by the way, was cut out, so they say, \nOf his wife's mother's flannelette nightie.\n\nWhat a mess when we met at the meet, \nThe Master of Hounds, Sergeant Nicholls,\nWas hacking away at the parson's nose, \nShouting, 'After you with the pickles.'\n\nWe each had to bring our own horse,\nSome brought stallions, some chestnuts and cobs. \nWhen I asked my wife, Flo, for a horse, she said 'No,\nI'm drying my thingummybobs.'\n\nOne lady was dressed up in style,\nHer figure was one in a million, \nI thought as I looked at her future, behind,\nWhat a chance for someone to ride pillion.\n\n'They're off!' someone cried, but we were'nt \nExcepting one lady, Miss Bullers;\nHer horse seemed to buck, and she came unstuck\nAnd showed her Grand National colours.\n\nTantivy, Tally Ho, Excelsior!\nTo start the hunt was the plan...\nAs we couldn't keep up with the fox,\nWe scrapped all the horses and ran.\n\nBeing a bit of a sportsman,\nI gave the poor devil a star...\nLive and Let Live ' is my motto, \nHaving a bookmaker's heart.\n\nThen off we went at full gallop, \nAfter the fox, good and hard,\nWhere caravans had rested\nAnd gee-gees had left their card.\n\n'Stick to the Scent.' someone shouted,\nWe did, from the very start. \nWe couldn't help it, riding behind\nA Corporation cart.\n\nWe trailed the fox for hours,\nTo have his blood I made a vow.\nThen it sprang up a tree, put its tongue out at me, \nCrossed its fingers and said, 'Catch me now.'\n\nAfter coaxing it down with some chocolate,\nI tried to get near to stroke it, \nIt made a noise like some fruit, which mean...\n'Put that in your pipe and smoke it!'\n\nThen it suddenly dashed through my legs, \nShot me into an empty cow shed,\nWhere I lay in some mud, while the cows chewed the cud...\nNot a bit like a strawberry bed.\n\nBut, once a sportsman, 'always,' \nI was soon up again on the track,\nAfter walking a bit, I shook hands with myself \nAs I met myself on the way back.\n\nI looked around for the 'pack' \nAnd found myself in Thames Ditton,\nThen I heard a child's voice shout, 'Mother, \nThere's a gentleman chasing our kitten.'\n\nThere's a moral to this story\nAs my tale to you has shown, \nIf you want a brush, you must be like the fox\nAnd grow a brush of your own.","url":"https:\/\/www.poemist.com\/billy-bennett\/the-huntsman","poet":{"name":"Billy

parent's accent knows,\nThe accents ever dear;\nUnlike the treacherous voice of foes,\nThat fills his heart with fear.\n\nHe runs to meet it; and it falls\nIn blessings and in joys;\nAnd thus whene'er
